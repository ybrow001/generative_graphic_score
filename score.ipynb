    "  - rhythmic/percussive accompaniment by mechanical sounds of drawing arm\n",
    "\n",
    "- image and drawing arm\n",
    "  - the score itself should follow certain patterns that the musician will be instructed to iterpret, this is the visual style of the piece. while indeterminate it should be consitent and recognisable accross many iterations\n",
    "  - this drawing will feature rhythmic patterns (and possibly other, e.g. harmonic, timbral - experiment with drawing arm), these are the percussive accompaniment. they are time based and embedded into the drawing proccess.\n",
    "  - rhythms possibly based on chord polyrhythms (maybe of a chord built using the hemi-pent scale 13457 or a cluster of the entire hept scale)\n",
    "  - 1/1 5/4 11/8 3/2 15/8 (factors/multiples of 8)\n",

    "  - played on harp\n",
    "  - tuned to major with a half sharp fourth 1 2 3 ^4 5 6 7 \n",
    "  - possible focus on 1 3 ^4 5 7 subset\n",
    "  - improvised using descending glissandi; sweeping motions with a higher probability of being downward rather than upward (this probability can be dynamic)\n",
    "  - a harp \"falling down stairs of light\" - concept/name of piece\n",
    "\n",
    "  - the machine will start drawing and then the musician will start reading it once it has drawn something (machine sould draw fast enought for the musician to play at the correct tempo)\n",
    "  - the piece will be interpreted live as it is drawn\n",
    "\n",
    "  - possibly work in motifs into the piece, for the performer to improvise off of, and/or to include in the score\n",
    "\n",
    "  - similar in stlye to \"love's song\"? - combining all elements, interlaced at once (noise, free improvisation, motifs, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    " -  3rd musical element\n",
    "  - playing samples of field recordings/ambient non-musical sounds\n",
    "  - have samples run into a mixer and give the performer instructions to use them\n",
    "   - parameters of fade-in/out duration, volume, duration of play\n",
    "   - layer and overlap sounds\n",
    "   - sound quality/timbre?\n",
    "  - performer interprets from the score\n",
    "\n",
    " - current concept for music\n",
    "  - 2 drawing machines drawing 2 scores for 2 performers\n",
    "  - both drawing machines mic'd up (possibly split polyrhythms between them based on 4:3 5:4 relationships, e.g. 15:12 vs. 10:8)\n",
    "  - performer 1 interprets 1 score to play harp\n",
    "  - performer 2 interprets the other to play the samples/mixer\n",
    "  - possible use of effects/techniques such as delay and feedback loops\n",
    "\n",
    " - possible 4th musical element:\n",
    "  - use same operations that generate score and rhythms to generate harmonic/noise/sample based sound via supercollider (audio software)\n",
    "  - as well as adding another layer, this can enable the piece to be an installation as well as a performance\n",
    "  - installation version can be reprogrammed to be more ambient and/or have more dynamic range so it varies from slow/ambient to intense/noisy\n"
